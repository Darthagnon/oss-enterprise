# Code of Conduct

## Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
Don't be evil. Be nice; don't be excessively unkind. If you must, condemn the behaviour, not the person. *"You are an idiot"* is unacceptably mean and personal, *"Your pull request is stupid because X reason"*, while impolite, may be necessary to get the message across. 

## Don't get offended 
It's the internet. A bit of trolling, cursing and short-tempered caffeine-fuelled moody development is expected. One is free to say what one wants; we are not Thought Police and don't care about political correctness. (though going out of one's way to be offensive won't get desired results)

## Be intelligent. 
Put in some thought before commenting; "eta wen?" or "this is brken, pls fixx" is discouraged.

## Don't talk about Fight Club
My work deals frequently with piracy, breaking licenses and stuff that is legally grey in the USA. Microsoft/GitHub are USA companies, so while we use their services, we must keep their law ("DMCA"), or we risk being banned. Discussion is encouraged, but **do not link to copyright-infringing material**. For example, *"SuperSoftware Tool 1.33.7 is available on 1337x.to"*, or *"Patch `0x0C345619` from `AB` to `CD`"* is okay, but *"Download SupuerSoftware Tool 1.33.7 from this link (drive.google.com/bla)"* violates DMCA and will be removed.

## Stay on topic
Keep discussion around pull requests and issues relevant to the initial topic. Don't hijack others' issues.
