# Code of Conduct

## Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
Be nice; don't be excessively unkind. Don't be evil. If you must, condemn the behaviour, not the person. *"You are an idiot"* is unacceptably mean and personal, *"Your pull request is stupid because X reason"*, while impolite, may be necessary to get the message across. 

## Don't get offended 
It's the internet. A bit of trolling, cursing and short-tempered caffeine-fuelled moody development is expected. One is free to say what one wants; you are adults, we are not Thought Police and don't care about political correctness, only about getting the job done. If someone says mean words to you, GROW UP. Remember, though, going out of one's way to be offensive won't get desired results.

## Be intelligent. 
Put in some thought before commenting; "eta wen?" or "this is brken, pls fixx" is discouraged.

## Don't talk about Fight Club
My work deals frequently with piracy, breaking licenses and stuff that is legally grey in the USA. Microsoft/GitHub are USA companies, so while we use their services, we must keep their law ("DMCA"), or we risk being banned. Discussion is encouraged, but **do not link to copyright-infringing material**. For example, *"SuperSoftware Tool 1.33.7 is available on 1337x.to"*, or *"Patch `0x0C345619` from `AB` to `CD`"* is okay, but *"Download SupuerSoftware Tool 1.33.7 from this link (drive.google.com/bla)"* violates DMCA and will be removed.

## Stay on topic
Keep discussion around pull requests and issues relevant to the initial topic. Don't hijack others' issues. Necroposting is fine - if you've solved that issue from 10 years ago, feel free to share.

## Write with style
Programming is boring. Funny, relevant commit messages are good. Except for internationalisation (i18n), programming and comments should be English, preferably British spellings and SI/metric measurements. Masculine pronouns only, for conciseness, elegance and consistency with Latin languages. That said, if you want to show off your flair for stylish writing and multilingual skills, go for it! Style and skill take precedence.
