# Contact Us

See the About section on the website [robot-one.github.io](https://robot-one.github.io) for contact details. We will typically respond within a week. Feel free to contact us with any questions about our projects or technical advice. We will try and help as time allows; if technical questions, you will be expected to put in work yourself.

## Organization and repository structure

Our repositories are not well organised, a mixture of public, private, online, offline, GitHub, GitLab. **The central organisation point for public information is the website [robot-one.github.io](https://robot-one.github.io).** Refer there first, and contact us if still in doubt.

## Who's who? Identifying maintainers, contributors, and the general public

When interacting in a repository owned by the Robot One organization, you are speaking on behalf of the Firm. 

Employees are identified with an OWNER badge:

Community members with prior contributions will be identified with a CONTRIBUTOR badge:

Those without prior contributions (i.e. Joe Public, Rando Cardassian) will not have a badge.

## Violating the Code of Conduct

Our [CODE OF CONDUCT](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) lays a baseline for contributor behaviour, and is very lenient. Don't take advantage of this leniency. Maintainers have a role similar to moderators from bulletin-board forums.

- Violations will be logged in an internal blacklist.
- Comments may be censored by moderators
- **1st strike**, if not critical, will be attributed to ignorance and warned. If critical, counts as a **2nd strike**. 
- **2nd strike** will be warned and may be [banned] from participation in the immediate project.
- **3rd strike** will be [banned] from participation in all projects, and external contact or spam will be [reported to GitHub]

[reported to GitHub]: https://help.github.com/articles/reporting-abuse-or-spam/
